# Django-curated-resources
Django Curated Resources is a project of mine that reflects upon the principles I took into consideration while starting the DailyCode project.
NOTE:  DailyCode and Django-Curated-Resources are the resource modules that would be available in DomeCode, a project created by me to help new coders learn from resources compiled from all over the internet, solve problems in our Remote Code Execution Environment in languages including Python, Java and, C++ initially.

Hope this project helps!
