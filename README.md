# Django-curated-resources
Django Curated Resources is a project of mine that reflects upon the principles I took into consideration while starting the DailyCode project.

##### NOTE:  DailyCode and Django-Curated-Resources are the resource modules that would be available in DomeCode, a project created by me to help new coders learn from resources compiled from all over the internet, solve problems in our Remote Code Execution Environment in languages including Python, Java and, C++ initially.

Hope this project helps! ‚ô•üôå

For getting started with any topic, I suggest trying it out before you actually move on to learning more about the technology through it's documentation first, trying out one of the projects from the documentation's tutorials yourself and playing with the code, learning through it. Once you're comfortable playing around with the code, it would be a good idea to use Corey Schafer's tutorials as a reference point for learning more about Django.

### FAQs üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- How much Django do I need to know before starting out with Django?
 
You are expected to know the basic concepts of Python along with how HTML and CSS tie in together ( preferably JS too ).

- How long would learning Django take?

Django is an intense framework and has a lot to offer which in turn means a lot to learn, so don't expect to master it anytime soon or anything but you can definitely learn enough to start building your own apps and figuring out everything yourself ( including figuring out how to search your issues effectively on Google/other search engine) the way a software/web developer would usually do.

- Is this framework good for large projects?

Django framework is built keeping in mind the larger projects hence is one of the most robust frameworks to get started with for larger projects. However for really simple and small projects, Flask is a good alternative due to a less complicated tree structure of required files to run the app but Django would work just as fine. 

Most importantly though, don't give up and eventually you will span over the whole Django framework and get really good at it, so just hang in there. ü™Ç
